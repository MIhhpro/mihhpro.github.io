# V15 project notes

## Version and scope

Active working folder: `V15/`. Created on 2026-09-05 from the latest V14 site, including all requested fixes. V14 is preserved as the previous snapshot. Start with [README.md](README.md) for the project map, preview instructions and check commands. No publication or external account changes were made when creating V15.

Owner preferences: natural Hungarian copy grounded in real experience; bronze/copper/gold/black styling; no blog. Use approved existing photos and retain the three intentional gallery placeholders for later photography. Keep Sikerek accessible in the header.

## Current service routes

- Introductory consultation: Calendly event configured as `consult`.
- Personal training: Calendly event configured as `pt`.
- Online coaching: Calendly event configured as `online`.
- Training Program: prepared email inquiry, service key `program`; no separate calendar event required.
- Other questions: prepared email route; no calendar is shown.

The owner has reinstated a standalone Training Program as a personalized 4-week product. It is distinct from the three monthly online-coaching packages.

## Important configuration

- Calendly links and the inquiry email live in `site-config.js`.
- Live calendar account: `https://calendly.com/mihaly-bence-fitness/`. Consultation uses `konzultacio`, personal training uses `30min`, online coaching uses `online-coaching`.
- Client-management email: `mihaly.bence.fitness@gmail.com`, supplied by the owner. Updated in the configuration, copy button, email links, Gmail compose route, no-JavaScript fallback and calendar fallback.
- The public site stays static and GitHub Pages compatible; Calendly manages bookings.

## Contact flow

1. The visitor enters their name, email, optional phone number, service, and optional message (maximum 1,500 characters).
2. All three live Calendly events were inspected on 2026-09-05. They collect full name, email and one free-text preparation question. Name/email are prefilled through the initial booking URL as well as the widget object; full and split names are included for compatibility with either name-field setting. The selected service/package, price, optional phone and message are combined into `a1`. Do not use the former three-question mapping. Online package links use `service=online&package=basic|plus|premium` and preserve the choice in the selector and booking notes. See `CALENDLY_SETUP.md` for the URL-encoding requirement and the deferred-message bug this avoids.
3. Training Program (`service=program`) and other questions offer a prefilled Gmail compose window and a provider-neutral copy-to-clipboard fallback containing the service, contact details and message. Nothing is sent by the site.
4. The widget loads on demand with a bounded wait and retry. A separate-window Calendly link preserves the same prefilled details. Email remains available if configuration or loading fails. Editing the form cancels pending handoffs and clears the previous widget. Booking confirmation accepts only a scheduling event from the currently displayed Calendly iframe.

## Visual direction

Continue the bronze, copper, gold and black visual direction requested by the owner. Use condensed display headings, restrained rounded cards, and thin warm borders. Preserve existing photographs; replacement photography is a later task. Avoid bright white surfaces and generic dashboard styling.

The V15 services and personal-training heroes use distinct editorial layouts within the same visual system. The homepage profile card uses restrained pointer depth rather than an exaggerated tilt. Keep future motion subtle and respect reduced-motion preferences.

The contact profile uses `assets/professional.png` in a compact portrait beside the name and credentials. At the owner's request, the large landscape crop, overlaid text and hover zoom were replaced with this quieter identity block. The source photograph is unchanged.

The contact page's direct email links open an addressed Gmail draft in a new tab, avoiding reliance on a configured desktop mail handler. A separate copy-address button and visible selectable address support other mail apps. Clipboard failure shows an explicit manual-copy fallback and restores keyboard focus.

## September 2026 experience update

- Added `online-coaching.html`: suitability, collaboration process, starting price, service-specific contact route and FAQ.
- Added `elso-alkalom.html`: consultation versus first training session, preparation, confirmed location, map link and practical questions.
- Rewrote all seven existing pages with a more personal Hungarian voice, grounded in Bence's supplied pull-up story and professional facts.
- Removed the public placeholder testimonials and client case studies. The success page now explains personal milestones and retains Bence's existing personal training material. Keep genuine client stories for a later update with consent.
- Removed empty gallery entries while preserving the three supplied life photographs and their personal captions. No image assets were changed.
- Unified prices and published the owner-approved online packages and weekly call frequencies above. Unconfirmed session length, gym-entry inclusion, response times, and other contract terms remain to be agreed before starting.
- Header: home, services, personal training, online coaching, about, successes (Sikerek), contact. Sikerek is a primary navigation item on every page and appears beside About in the mobile menu. A homepage feature below the visitor starting-point cards links directly to the progress and personal milestones page. First visit and the About gallery remain accessible in the mobile menu and footer.
- Added skip navigation, visible keyboard focus, mobile-menu focus handling, accessible FAQs, reduced-motion handling and gallery-dialog focus restoration.
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript architecture and GitHub Pages compatibility remain unchanged. This is the local V15 working version; no hosting configuration or external booking settings were changed.

## About gallery consolidation

- Moved the three existing personal photographs and their full captions to `about.html#galeria`, after the personal story. The existing keyboard-accessible photo viewer is reused.
- Added four photo spaces at the owner's request. The tall portrait now uses the owner-approved `assets/shirtless.png` with a personal-training caption and the existing accessible photo viewer. Three spaces remain intentionally empty: landscape training, movement and coaching-session shots.
- Suggested image names, proportions and replacement instructions are documented next to each frame in `about.html`. Place a real image directly inside the frame with meaningful alt text; the frame supports an image overlay and caption. Add `gallery-item` and `data-note` if the new photograph should also open in the viewer.
- Removed the separate `life.html` page. All previous mobile-menu and footer links now lead to `about.html#galeria` with the label Galéria.
- Main navigation remains compact. The About hero has local links to the story, gallery and qualifications.

## Latest fixes and section navigation

- Device/performance pass: added `responsive.css` after the existing styles on all eight pages. Covers touch targets, small-screen typography and spacing, buttons that wrap, portrait/landscape layouts, safe-area insets, keyboard-focused forms and 320px-wide Calendly space. Original palette is preserved. The floating scroll-to-top button is inert behind open menus/dialogs and is below their layers.
- Six original PNGs now have 24 WebP delivery copies in `assets/responsive/`. Largest copies total 842,138 bytes versus 12,882,180 original bytes (93.5% reduction). Original PNG files are unchanged. Pages use `srcset`/`sizes`; below-fold images are lazy and hero photos prioritized. Gallery cloning removes thumbnail size hints and loads `data-full-src` for the large view.
- Calendly auto-height now uses the site's single origin/source-checked message handler and validates the reported height. SDK `resize` is false to avoid accumulating listeners or unsolicited scroll calls when rebuilding the widget. Prefill and the black/gold theme are unchanged.
- See [PUBLISHING_CHECKLIST.md](PUBLISHING_CHECKLIST.md) before launch. The owner already owns the domain and will connect it later. Current automated checks pass, but do not describe these code changes as verified on every physical device: browser visual QA and real booking/email-delivery checks remain outstanding.

- Calendly theme correction: the owner rejected the bronze/beige whole-widget workaround and explicitly requested the original colours. Restored black `100f0c`, cream text `f5f0e8` and gold `d4a843` for both inline and fallback booking. The prefill fix is preserved. Dark input text could not be independently retained through Calendly's supported settings; the reported pale-on-light field contrast remains unresolved. Do not recolour the whole widget again or claim this field-specific problem is fixed. See `CALENDLY_SETUP.md` for the confirmed iframe styling limitation.

- V15 typography/detail pass: removed the requested email-route helper sentence and hide its empty paragraph for Training Program and general questions; restore the relevant hint when switching back to booking or no selection.
- All visible forint amounts use nonbreaking spaces. Inline `span.price-amount` keeps the amount, currency and suffix together, inheriting the surrounding font/colour so price-card captions cannot shrink the number. Native select options use nonbreaking spaces without nested markup. Preserve this formatting when changing prices.
- Heading anchors have the same fixed-header clearance as sections. Form inputs/selects use 1rem text to avoid the small-input zoom trigger on phones. The online hero price row can wrap the billing period separately on narrow screens.
- Images now declare their source dimensions to reserve space during loading. The contact calendar scrolls into view once on submission rather than pulling the visitor back after the external script finishes loading. Failure paths still reveal the error/fallback.

- Gallery lightbox image sizing uses `object-fit: contain` on the cloned image itself. Narrow layouts scroll the panel to keep both the complete photograph and caption reachable. Pricing introductions nested in section headings have positive spacing after the heading.
- Contact portrait: compact image alongside the name and credentials, with no overlaid caption or hover zoom. Contact email links open addressed Gmail drafts; copying is a separate action with clear feedback.

- Every page has a native section index inside `main`, enhanced by `section-nav.js` and `section-nav.css`. Wide screens (at least 1480px wide and 600px tall) show a copper/gold side rail; smaller screens use an expandable “Oldal tartalma” control. The active marker follows reading position, and hidden contact-flow sections enter the index only when available. Native anchors preserve URL/history, keyboard focus and reduced-motion scrolling. Without JavaScript the index remains in normal page flow. Placement inside `main` shares the existing mobile-menu and gallery-dialog inert handling.
## Validation

- `tests/calendly-prefill.cjs <path-to-downloaded-widget.js>`: optional integration check using Calendly's actual public widget. Verifies the generated iframe URL contains full/split names, email and notes for all three services without relying on iframe-load messages. Passed against the widget downloaded on 2026-09-05; no live booking was made.

- `tests/email-copy.cjs`: successful copying, denied clipboard permission, unavailable legacy clipboard, user feedback, temporary-field cleanup and keyboard focus.
- `tests/section-nav.cjs`: scroll tracking, conditional sections, keyboard focus, compact disclosure and focus across responsive changes.

- `tests/validate.py`: eight pages; element nesting, local files, anchors, ARIA references, labels, metadata and content checks. Requires Python with lxml.
- `tests/contact-flow.cjs`: isolated script tests for all three calendar routes, email preparation, clipboard content, optional message handling, service switching, form validation, unavailable calendar, scheduling confirmation and mobile-menu keyboard focus. Runs with Node.js; sends no requests.
- The contact checks also cover route-hint visibility when switching services and prevent a second scroll after successful calendar loading. All automated checks passed after the V15 typography/detail pass; browser appearance has not been reverified.
- JavaScript syntax checked with Node.js.
- The public booking flows for all three new events were inspected up to the invitee-details form, without submitting. Verified current duration/location: consultation 20 minutes at Hatvany Lajos u. 10; personal training 1 hour at the same address (despite the `30min` URL); online coaching 1 hour, conferencing details after confirmation. The configured dark/gold colours were visually confirmed on the public Calendly page.
- No real appointments booked or emails sent. Complete live booking confirmation, email-delivery and site-level responsive checks before publication.
